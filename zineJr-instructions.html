<h3>Zine Jr. Instructions</h3>
<p>Zine Jr., a mini-workbook, created so that you can write field notes and dreams sparked from the activities prompted in <a href="{{ site.data.content.zine_link }}">the Zine</a> and <a href="/#podcast">the podcast</a>. </p>

For best results, <a href="/zineJr_PreserveThisPodcastWorkshop.pdf" target="blank">print Zine Jr.</a> on one 8/5" x 11" page, front and back. Then follow these instructions on how to cut and fold into a booklet:</p>

<ul>
  <ol> Fold the paper in half, long way, like a celery or hot dog. It's best to fold both ways to make the spine flexible.</ol>
  <ol> Open the paper and fold it in half, the shorter way, like a tomato or hamburger.</ol>
  <ol> Re-open the paper and fold the along the dotted lines so that the shorter edges meet in the middle. The page should be creased to make eight rectangular sections.</ol>
  <ol> Cut along the dotted lines between the two middle rectangles, above the "Exercise 01" and "My Next Steps" boxes.</ol>
  <ol>Fold the zine so that the hamburger image side is on the inside and edge that was cut open meets in the middle like a plus sign.</ol>
</ul>
