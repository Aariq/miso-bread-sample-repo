excerpt: The lost history of podcasts.
summary: “The Podsucker” is a machine that Jason Scott built in his basement 15 years ago. Jason was trying to capture all the podcasts -- before they disappear. Preserve This Podcast is a series about how podcasts are disappearing. And what podcasters can do to save them. Follow along with our podcast preservation exercises by downloading the zine at preservethispodcast.org.
